# AdventOfCode2022
Thanks to my super awesome roommate I was reminded this existed and decided to give a try starting 2 weeks late. 
The code is probably super un-optimised but this is about the most difficult thing I've done in C since ECE 209 was a complete joke that didn't get past arrays.
As of 12/21/2022 23:45 EDT, there are no comments in the code because I live dangerously, the functions should have decent names, and some of the variables are possibly random from me just thinking of names.
On the flip side I learned how to parse files and use malloc, thanks stackoverflow and Ryan. 

On 12/22/22 I pushed my code from CLion to the git. Aparently some things were different between the two as far back as Day2 Part2. I do not know why. As far as I know this has no immediate consequences.
